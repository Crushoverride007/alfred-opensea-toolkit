# Alfred Toolkit for OpenSea

The OpenSea Toolkit for Alfred makes it easy to quickly access OpenSea features, including search, your profile, and more with the `opensea` keyword.

You can also create new NFTs with the `new` and `NFT` keywords.

You will need to be signed in to your GitHub account in your default web browser to make the most of this workflow.
